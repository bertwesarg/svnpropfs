This file system exports subversion properties in a work-tree as virtual files.
Properties on files will be named as '.#<filename>#<propname>' and on
directories as '.#<propname>' as file inside the directory. It also hides the
'.svn' directory in directory listings. These virtual files are hidden for
common svn commands like svn, svnadmin, svnlook, and kdesvn.

Usage:
    svnpropfs <svn-work-tree>

Dependencies:
 * Python (its currently hardcoded to python2.6 in the hash-bang)
 * pysvn (http://pysvn.tigris.org)
   Install with 'apt-get install python-svn' on debian based systems.
 * The python interface to FUSE is included and comes
   from http://code.google.com/p/fusepy/
